# hospital-lib

I completed the Quarantine class, with the implementation of all its methods.

I also added `drugRules.ts` and its corresponding test file `drugRules.spec.ts`. 
It contains the different rules for each drug.

All is scalable and tested. 

One way I would have improved this, is by using `enums` for the patients symptoms.
